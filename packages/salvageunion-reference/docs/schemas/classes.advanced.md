      "value": "Engineers form an integral component of the Union, the grease that keeps our Mechs and Crawlers trundling across the great wastelands. They can take apart and put back together a Mech Chassis in the blink of an eye, and keep their salvage crew operational out in the wastes. Choose an Engineer if you want a character with a breadth of engineering and mechanical knowledge; who can repair and support you and your allies' Mechs, mount Mech parts significantly faster, and allow you to craft Mech parts in the field."
