Choose a Hacker if you want access to specialised hacking Abilities, to play a character with a wide range of knowledge about technology, or are interested in augmenting your character beyond the flesh."

This can-do attitude makes them a shoo-in for leadership roles, as other salvagers look up to them for their sheer tenacity. Play a Hauler if you want to play a hardy character who can haul large amounts of cargo, make tough deals, and protect and inspire their allies."
