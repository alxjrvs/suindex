Hackers are constantly experimenting with new ways to craft Mech components, and many augment their bodies with a range of modifications, finding their flesh as dull as a long system update. Choose a Hacker if you want access to specialised hacking Abilities, to play a character with a wide range of knowledge about technology, or are interested in augmenting your character beyond the flesh."

This can-do attitude makes them a shoo-in for leadership roles, as other salvagers look up to them for their sheer tenacity. Play a Hauler if you want to play a hardy character who can haul large amounts of cargo, make tough deals, and protect and inspire their allies."

Play a Salvager if you want to be a jack of all trades who can draw from multiple different Abilities as suits your play style. Salvagers can take a maximum of 12 Pilot Abilities, and can choose Abilities from any of the Core Ability trees from any Class. However they cannot advance into any of the Hybrid Classes, nor do they have any Advanced or Legendary Abilities."
