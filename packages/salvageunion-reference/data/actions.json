This allows you to specify any target of your choice from the huge to the small. You can choose a wide blast to destroy a settlement, or Mech convoy, or a pinpoint strike to kill a single person. The Orbital Lance only deals as much collateral damage as you want it to. The target you choose is killed or destroyed entirely.\n\nYou may only claim one Orbital Lance Controller per Union Crawler, others must be found in the wastelands.
